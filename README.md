This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in ActionScript 3 related to accessing array elements at extremely large indices.  While attempting to access an index significantly beyond the array's current size might not always immediately produce a RangeError, it can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes down the line. The bug.as file showcases the problematic code, while bugSolution.as offers a robust solution.  The issue highlights the importance of careful array index handling in ActionScript 3, particularly when dealing with dynamically sized arrays or user inputs.
